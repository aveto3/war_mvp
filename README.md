### Overview
This project, made as a project for Wolverine Sports Analytics at the University of Michigan, attempts to determine if the correlation between bWAR and awards voting has increased in the modern era. As advanced analytics have become more mainstream, it has become a common comment that the BWAA determines the winners of awards solely based on their WAR. This project aims to address that comment â€“ is it true that WAR is more of a deciding factor in voting, and if so, is that a bad thing?
